# empirical-test-of-sorting-algorithms
This program is designed to empirically test the most popular sorting algorithms' complexity.
The project was implemented as part of CSE 246 - Analysis of Algorithms course at Marmara University. It was implemented with Java.

It does so, by counting the number of basic operations with increasing array sizes. More details can be seen in Measurements and Homework report files.
